####Just a note regarding a fairly basic upgrade to an existing standard immersion control system

#### *The panel on the left is the control interface for the immersion heater for hot water. Too many times the immersion had been left on – waisting electricity. Details of the workings are to follow. The installation was the normal standard – dual immersion (sink/bath) installed in cylinder upstairs with a local (to the immersion) On/Off and Sink/Bath selection switch.*

#### *So, one would run upstairs to turn it on but forget to return to turn it off. Oh – to have a facility to do the switching down stairs without running new cables and messing up the plaster. Turns out that the immersion draws a fair amount of current and, as such, has it’s own circuit with a circuit breaker in the consumer box which is located in the utility – very accessible when working in the kitchen. One could use the breaker as a switch but this would not be very elegant. Also, it would be nice to switch immersion on for a specified duration.* 

#### *One solution is a controlled relay in series with the circuit breaker. The panel depicted allows the user control this relay. Pressing the red button turns off relay if it had been turned on, pressing the black button turns on the relay for a time specified by the position of the grey rotary knob (flat screwdriver could be used but stem is long enough to allow adjustment using thumb and forefinger). Pressing and holding the black button allows the user to adjust the time using the grey rotary with feedback to the user being audio tones, i.e. different tones are heard depending on the rotary position. Releasing the black button causes the relay to stay on for the duration set by the rotary position. This technique is basic but gives the user feedback without using a display of some sort.*
